Smart System for Listening Exam is a combination of both desktop and android applications.
Desktop application works as a server, where teacher can host an examination by providing the
link to stream audio, accept the request of the students according to their sent information, take the
attendance of the students and play the audio for the test.

And the android application works as a client in the user end. Student have to use this application
to attend the test. A student has to provide the required information to login into the application.
Then he sends request to seat in the examination and after accepting the request from the server he
can play the audio for the test.

Students can play the audio just for once. Students cannot pause or stop the audio. Only the teacher
can pause, stop or change the audio.
